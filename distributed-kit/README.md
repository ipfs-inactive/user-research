# IPFS user research | Complete distributed toolkit

**What is the simple but complete set of tools, templates, API features and documentation that allows web developers to build distributed applications on top of IPFS and libp2p?**

## Background

([Original work plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ea5ZMT5Ld7LrjgCB6Uc3p91OoTIAF3wZbpfRFciO0vg/edit?usp=sharing)üîí)

This area of focus was originally part of a project to document user journeys around key IPFS use cases.

We wanted to:
* Understand the motivations, needs, context, constraints, etc of people who are building distributed applications on IPFS
* Identify ‚Äúcritical paths‚Äù for users to successfully navigate our documentation, APIs, and support channels when building and deploying distributed applications on IPFS 

This would have also support related goals, which which were not the main focus of the user journeys project:
* Identify points of pain for these users
* Reinforce relationships with strategic partners who are building decentralized applications on IPFS

_Historical note: this was originally called "Burger and fries", which was a reference to the creation of McDonalds, where they realized people preferred a simple, fast dinner over a slow elaborate meal, so McDonalds optimized for something that was simple but complete - a burger and fries. We've opted for more straightforward naming for clarity._

## Status

We have not yet developed explicit user journeys for this work. However! Starting in spring 2018, IPFS did extensive research into the IPFS onboarding process and related documentation.

We wanted to:
* Help developers feel confident & prepared to begin
* Recommend a strategy for improving the on-ramp(s) to IPFS adoption
* Start implementing improvements to our documenation and communication, based on that strategy.

That research revealed that:
* There is no clear introduction to the overall idea of exactly how IPFS works and what it‚Äôs doing.
* IPFS has lots of new concepts (whether you are knowledgeable about things like graphs or not) that are just very different from the web technologies people know today.
* Docs are inconsistently located and spread across a number of repos people have to hunt through.
* Clear, standard API docs are not always available.
* Hunting through GitHub is hard. (Which repos have docs? Where in the repo are they? Which projects are important and how do they relate to the others? Which repos and docs are up-to-date?)

## Next steps

Our IPFS onboarding and documentation research provided enough insight into the current user journey for people who would like to build distributed apps on IPFS and libp2p. We should not conduct more research. Instead, we should implement the strategy tracked in our [ipfs/docs repo](https://github.com/ipfs/docs) and [issues](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/issues).
