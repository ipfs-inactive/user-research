# IPFS user research 

The IPFS ecosystem of open-source projects has user research and other useful documentation on how people would like to interact with IPFS; where their painpoints are; what is going well for them; what is going less well for them; etc. However, that work is currently spread out across hundreds of repos, websites, and Google docs. This repo will serve as an index for IPFS user research, and will be where future user research work will be project managed (ie, you will be able to track issues and roadmaps similar to how you might track a code-based project). User research outputs (reports, presentations, etc) will also live here.

## Repo roadmap

1. We've got a README! **<-- U R HERE**
1. Create skeleton repo wiki to hold roadmaps, etc.
1. Migrate existing user research (or links to research) here so this can serve as index for that work
1. Add current understanding of problem statements and user research roadmaps to wiki
1. Issues reflect ongoing and planned work

## Areas of focus

In 2018, IPFS is gathering information and user needs in two areas:

1. What is the simple but complete set of tools, templates, API features and documentation that allows web developers to build distributed applications on top of IPFS and libp2p? ([Original work plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ea5ZMT5Ld7LrjgCB6Uc3p91OoTIAF3wZbpfRFciO0vg/edit?usp=sharing)ðŸ”’)
1. How might one store and transfer terabytes or petabytes of data using IPFS? ([Original work plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rNYIg6sQoRYDVcvQ8oPbJ4ov6Dbque5Hcvn44q7qk4A/edit?usp=sharing)ðŸ”’)

## Code of Conduct

As part of the IPFS project, this repo follows the [`IPFS Community Code of Conduct`](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
